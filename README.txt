This repository contains the data and code for the paper “Social influence in adolescence as a double-edged sword” by Lucas Molleman, Simon Ciranka and Wouter van den Bos. 
There are 2 data files (Data summary.txt and BEAST_data.txt). The data summary was collated right from the LIONESS Lab export files associated with each of the tasks (traffic lights task, Dictator Games and BEAST). Participant numbers were recorded in each task and used to match data for participants across tasks. 
All experimental code is available in editable versions on the LIONESS Lab platform. You can get a free account via lioness-lab.org.
All R scripts are extensively commented. Scripts with names starting with “Fig” produce the corresponding Figures as shown in the main text and in the Supplementary Information. The file niceHistograms.r defines coloured histograms used for Fig. S6. 
The file “Statistical analysis (Tables S1-5).r” gathers all statistical analyses reported in the paper, and produces a txt version of Table S1 and HTML versions of Tables S2-5.
